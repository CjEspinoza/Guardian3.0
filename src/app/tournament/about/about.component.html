        <h1>WELCOME GAMERS</h1>

        <p> The Guardian team is happy to announce our upcoming Guardian Tournament.
            There will be 3 esports games to be featured in this year's Tournament. We are hoping to provide
            a platform for students who are passionate about these games, to create a community filled
            with passion and excitement.</p>

        <p>
            Due to the current situation our country is in, our current plans for the tournament will change.
            There are no specific dates on when will our tournament start. We encourage everyone to stay at home and be safe. 
            We will keep everyone updated with our plans and actions. We will post all our updates and news in our Guardian newsfeed
            or in our update page. Thank you for your patience and understanding, stay safe and God bless.
        </p>
